[Think Stats Chapter 4 Exercise 2](http://greenteapress.com/thinkstats2/html/thinkstats2005.html#toc41) (a random distribution)

Exercise 4.2   The numbers generated by random.random are supposed to be uniform between 0 and 1; that is, every value in the range should have the same probability. Generate 1000 numbers from random.random and plot their PMF and CDF. Is the distribution uniform?

```python
import random
import thinkstats2
import thinkplot

# Generate list of 1,000 random numbers
rand = [random.random() for x in range(1000)]

# Calculate the pmf and cdf
rand_pmf = thinkstats2.Pmf(rand)
rand_cdf = thinkstats2.Cdf(rand)

# Plot the pmf and cdf
thinkplot.PrePlot(2, cols=2)
thinkplot.pmf(rand_pmf, linewidth=0.1)
thinkplot.Config(xlabel='value', ylabel='pmf')

thinkplot.PrePlot(2)
thinkplot.SubPlot(2)
thinkplot.cdf(rand_cdf)
thinkplot.Config(xlabel='value', ylabel='cdf')

thinkplot.Show()
```

By graphing the PMF and CDF we can see that the distribution is uniform. In the PMF plot, each value is the same length indicating they areequally likely to be observed. In the cdf plot, we see the an approximate straight line, indicating a uniform distribution of percentile ranks.
